# Life-Expectancy-Applied-ML-Project

The Life expectancy dataset is a dataset collected by WHO  and is posted on the kaggle website. The above data is availabe on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who .
My solution to the above dataset is present at the link: https://www.kaggle.com/guptaaryan16/life-expectancy-project-auc-85

I learned about various models in Machine Learning in Data Science Group(DSG), IIT Roorkee and this project is an attempt to utilize them to effectively predict the Life expectancy range values for various countries.
This model achieved an accuracy of 85% on the training and validation data and 80% on the test data.

# About the Dataset
The project relies on accuracy of data. The Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository under World Health Organization (WHO) keeps track of the health status as well as many other related factors for all countries The data-sets are made available to public for the purpose of health data analysis. The data-set related to life expectancy, health factors for 193 countries has been collected from the same WHO data repository website and its corresponding economic data was collected from United Nation website.

### Acknowledgements
The data was collected from WHO and United Nations website with the help of Deeksha Russell and Duan Wang.

### Inspiration
The data-set ,and predited analysis and model aims to answer the following key questions:

 - Does various predicting factors which has been chosen initially really affect the Life expectancy?
 - What are the predicting variables actually affecting the life expectancy?
- Should a country having a lower life expectancy value(<65) increase its healthcare expenditure in order - to improve its average lifespan?
- How does Infant and Adult mortality rates affect life expectancy?
- Does Life Expectancy has positive or negative correlation with eating habits, lifestyle, exercise, - smoking, drinking alcohol etc.
- What is the impact of schooling on the lifespan of humans?
- Does Life Expectancy have positive or negative relationship with drinking alcohol?
- Do densely populated countries tend to have lower life expectancy?
- What is the impact of Immunization coverage on life Expectancy?
